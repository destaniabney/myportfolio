         <a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="group" data-caption= "The purpose of this project was to create a seamless pattern utilizing tools in Adobe Illustrator and transform it into a tangible object. My personal process consisted of brainstorming, sketching, rendering and then brainstorming again. I found myself having a hard time deciding what direction my pattern should take and after many many trials and errors this is my final product. Taking inspiration from a previous project, I decided to go with a tropical theme. I went through decisions like what kind of leaves to illustrate, should there be fruit or maybe flowers. In the end i decided that the answer was clean, crisp, simplicity. Once my swatch was created and the product was received, I regretfully decided to sew together a throw pillow, which was a very tedious process in which I stuck myself with the needle several times. Looking back at this project, I'd say overall it was a fun learning experience. Though I am quite familiar with illustrator, I had never made a seamless pattern before and I feel that its skill I could easily find use for again. Of it all, I'd say my favorite part was seeing something I created become a tangible everyday object."rel="gallery" href="images/seamlesspattern2.png"><img src="images/seamlessPattern.png" width="24.5%" height="24.5%"</a>

         <a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="group" data-caption="The Tropical Mix Stamps are a product of a digital illustration project in which were given the task of concepting and illustrating a cohesive series of stamps with a food theme of our choice. I chose to go with a fruit theme based off of the variety of options and the colorful palette. My initial idea was to do simple animated illustrations of fruit with faces in a caricature style. After starting to render them, I decided that I didnt like the childlike aspect that they were giving off. At that point, I decided to go for a more realistic yet still minimal style, which I think turned out a lot better. My process began with finding inspiration on how I wanted the fruit to be displayed. I went through options like doing a close up of each fruits skin or pulp or simple displaying the fruit as a whole. I ended up going with a mix between the two to give the illustrations just a little more interest. I illustrated each fruit by hand, stopping to google some things along the way. After the WIP critique some changes were made in the details of each fruit and from that point it was mostly smooth sailing although I did struggle a little with composition during my process, I couldn't decide what I could do to the background that would give them a little boost without distracting to much from the fruit. I finally settled on a subtle gradient behind each fruit and these are my final products. This was a challenging but overall fun project. It served as really good practice of effectively using color to make objects appear 3 dimensional. One of the main things I learned was how the effects in illustrator can be used to create realistic textures in your illustrations. This is something I feel will be useful moving forward not only in this class but also in many design projects to come." rel="gallery" href="images/stamps2.png"><img src="images/stamps.png" width="25%" height="24.5%"</a>

The stakes were made with no do overs or re-recordings, giving them a much more personalized feel than most of today’s TV dramas.

The project required an entire brand identity including aspects like a logo, icons, posters and tshirts. The overall theme of the festival is adventure and the great outdoors and the target was young professionals. With this information students were given free will to position the client as they would like.My concept was to take a different take on the idea of nature. Rather than display the normal trees and mountains and fuzzy little animals, I chose to take the Urban take on nature drawing inspiration from the tiny bits of green that often time break through the slabs of concrete in the hustle and bustle of the city. Once I established a concept that made sense, I began the brainstorming process. Starting with mind maps, research, and sketches I starting getting ideas for the logo. I came up with several options ranging from just type to just a mark and everything in between. I ended up choosing a combination logo. Finding contrasting typefaces was probably the hardest part of this process. From there I moved on to the poster which was quite honestly THE HARDEST PART!! I struggled a lot with find a interesting way to layout the typography. The poster is one of the only aspects that I changed multiple times. The next step in my process was to design the Tshirt. I chose to use only the logo mark on my first round of shirts. My reasoning behind this was to mirror the Modern, sort of simplistic style of the rest of my items onto my shirt. I later designed another graphic that I believe still follows the theme of my entire project.

                <h2>DESIGNER, WIFE, AND AVID DOG LOVER...</h2>
            <p>Hello, world! My name is Destani June. I enjoy long walks on the beach, reading books and other very cliche things. But you're not here to read about who I am, You're hear to know about what I do. <br> <br> Design is what I do! I am a recent college graduate with a bachelors degree in Strategic Communications and because I believe that one can never have enough knowledge,  I am also in the process of pursuing a Bachelors of Fine Arts in graphic design. "Why?" you may ask, well I look at it as graphic design gives me the freedom to be creative, embrace my childlike imagination and strategy allows me to apply it all to being a visual problem solver.</p>
